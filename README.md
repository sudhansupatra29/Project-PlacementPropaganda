HALLOW, 
This is an internship helper; this is still in its very early stages.
There is no fixed plan as to what this will be; I am iterating it every day.
============================================================================================================================================
This is actually a hackathon project for my team.
============================================================================================================================================
ANYWAYS, to anyone who wishes to test this out, the following are the steps on what to do after you clone this.
1. Get a Groq cloud API, _or_ technically any API **_but_**_ then you'll have to tinker the code slightly.
(Replace the AI model that you'd want to use and also some of the identifiers, which are not really necessary, but it's good to be organised.)
2. Get Node.js as the backend is entirely built on that.
3. Go to Backend/ open a command prompt there, or "terminal" for all Unix-based fellas out there.
4. Type in "npm install" & "npm install bcrypt" in it, now you have all the modules required.
5. It is also recommended to have a Firebase too. This one is optional (unless you get an error).
6. Make a ".env" file and paste in the GROQ_API_KEY, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID and FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL in there (you'll fill them with your own resources).
7. Lastly, in the command prompt window, type in "node server.js".
============================================================================================================================================
You're good to go ahead and test.
